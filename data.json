Chimera Linux does not have a system installer, instead providing manual command line instructions to bootstrap the operating system from a live environment.","distrowatch_page":"https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=chimera","image_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571526/icons/chimera_linux.png.png","homepage":"https://chimera-linux.org/","light_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571527/light_badges/chimera_linux.png.png","dark_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571528/dark_badges/chimera_linux.png.png"},{"id":"223be2d8-4712-4f5e-b8ee-ff3cb971bafc","identifier":"blendos","name":"blendOS","description":"blendOS is an Arch Linux-based, rolling-release distribution which automates installing software from supported distributions (Arch Linux, Fedora and Ubuntu) into containers. blendOS tries to make software management in across containers feel native and provides access to the user\"s home directory for each container.","distrowatch_page":"https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=blendos","image_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571532/icons/blendos.png.png","homepage":"https://blendos.co/","light_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571533/light_badges/blendos.png.png","dark_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754571534/dark_badges/blendos.png.png"},{"id":"45e6d822-c536-4a92-83e8-190b4d3094c2","identifier":"linux_kodachi","name":"Linux Kodachi","description":"Linux Kodachi is a Debian-based distribution which can be run from a DVD or USB thumb drive.

That\"s the way the TFM Linux idea was born. The simplest method at that time was the adaptation of Red Hat distribution to the needs previously specified. So in March 2001 TFM Linux 1.0 was launched. An easy to install operating system, easy to use as server edition or workstation and adapted for the user\"s needs. All the knowledge gathered during all this time, allowed the observation of the modified Red Hat distribution limits, and, as future plan, it was established that the next version of the distribution will be done starting from zero, for having complete control to what is happening in the distribution and the packages interactions.","distrowatch_page":"https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=tfm","image_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576432/icons/tfm_linux.png.png","homepage":"http://www.tfm.ro/","light_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576434/light_badges/tfm_linux.png.png","dark_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576435/dark_badges/tfm_linux.png.png"},{"id":"0e2c11f9-3823-438d-8ee8-08125401bcb1","identifier":"toorox","name":"Toorox","description":"Toorox is a Gentoo-based live DVD which boots into a KDE desktop using KNOPPIX hardware auto-detection and auto-configuration technologies.

Then, after having tested a few of the existing big cdbootable systems that were very slow and had very poor performance, a new project started to take shape in my mind. After some late nights investigating some existing soloutions, my own concept was born: 1. Use a commercial distribution as base (Mandrake Linux). 2. Implement as much as possible of the original functions without many hardware/memory requirements. 3. Put as much software as possible on one cd. 4. Make it easy to configure / Autodetect as much as possible. 5. Implement live filesystem compression. 6. Ramdisk Compression.","distrowatch_page":"https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=virtual","image_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576466/icons/virtual-linux.png.png","homepage":null,"light_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576467/light_badges/virtual-linux.png.png","dark_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754576468/dark_badges/virtual-linux.png.png"},{"id":"f8642cd5-1326-4021-bad0-698963a48230","identifier":"vzlinux","name":"VzLinux","description":"VzLinux, a product of Virtuozzo International GmbH, is a free and open-source distribution built from the source code for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Its initial creation was sponsored by the Beauregard Parish Public Library in DeRidder, USA out of self interest. We have several servers and over 50 workstations running Red Hat Linux and were left high and dry by Red Hat\"s recent shift in business plan.

Additionally, WOMP! can also be installed on the hard drive - either to run in memory just like a bootable CD, or to run from a read-only loopback file which is interesting for machines with low memory. It can then be booted either by a floppy boot disk or by a bootable CD. WOMP! uses FrameBuffer for playing videos and X for interacting with the user. Hardware acceleration is provided by vidix. Cards that support vidix include nearly all ATI and Matrox cards, and more recent NVIDIA cards.","distrowatch_page":"https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=womp","image_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754577393/icons/womp%21.png.png","homepage":"http://womp.sourceforge.net/","light_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754577394/light_badges/womp%21.png.png","dark_badge_path":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dlhsg4plt/image/upload/v1754577395/dark_badges/womp%21.png.png"},{"id":"9269d77a-deb1-4954-907b-a3f0dd5bb4bd","identifier":"yoper_linux","name":"Yoper Linux","description":"Yoper is a multipurpose high performance operating system which has been carefully optimised for PC\"s with either 686 or higher processor types.
